## ACID

- `A` Atomicity
    
    The whole transaction should be considered as a minimum unit, which is atomicity, indivisible

- `C` Consistency

    A transaction brings the data from one state to another, without violating all the rules and constrains, including triggers

- `I` Isolation

    Isolation is for concurrent transactions(concurrency control). If concurrency happens, it should result in the same state where the transactions is executed sequentially. So, each transaction is isolated with another.

- `D` Durability

    Makes sure state saved after committed.

## CAP

#### CAP theorem(AKA, Brewer's theorem)

- `C` Consistency

    Every read receives the most recent write or an error.

    > Note that, `Consistency` here is quite different from that of [ACID](#ACID)

- `A` Available

    __Every request receives a (non-error) response__ â€“ without guarantee that it contains the most recent write.

- `P` Partition tolerance

    __The system continues to operate__ despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.

    Partition, in this context, means partition network

> Distributed system can never fulfill all the three guarantees.
