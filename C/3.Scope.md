# Scope of C

## Scope of C Variables

### Variable escape

Function of `C` should never return a pointer which is defined inside it, because the pointed address can be reallocated to another variable of another function. Consider the following example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int *test() {
    int a = 1;
    printf("%p\n", &a);
    return &a;
}

int *test2() {
    int a = 2;
    printf("%p\n", &a);
    return &a;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int *a = test();
    printf("a=%d\n", *a);
    test2();
    printf("a=%d\n", *a);
}
```

and the result will be something similar

```text
0x7ffee91dd8bc
a=1
0x7ffee91dd8bc
a=2
```

which demonstrates the variable `int a` in function `test` and `test2` both are allocated the same address, and the modification of the content of that address will affect the returned value in function `main`.

 However, you can return a pointer which is **not** defined inside, such as a pointer passed to this function. For example:

 ```c
int *test(int *i) {
  return i;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int *p, i;
    p = test(&i);
}
```

And there's no `variable escape` problem with that, since the variable `i` will not be destroyed when `test` finished its execution.

### extern

```text
/workspace
  |
  `-- main.c
      test.c
```

In file `main.c`

```c
int sth = 1;
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
}
```

In file `test.c`

```c
extern int sth;

void print() {
    printf("%d\n", sth);
}
```
