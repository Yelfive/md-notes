# PECL vs PEAR

## PECL

> `PECL` stands for **PHP Extension Community Library**, it has extensions written in C, that can be loaded into PHP to provide additional functionality. You need to have administrator rights, a C compiler and associated toolchain to install those extensions.

## PEAR

> `PEAR` is **PHP Extension and Application Repository**, it has libraries and code written IN php. Those you can simply download, install and include in your code.

## examples
