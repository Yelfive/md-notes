# Cascade Operations

```php
<?php

namespace App\Entity;

class Comment
{
    /**
     * @var User
     * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="App\Entity\User", cascade={"all"})
     */
    protected $user;
}

```

Cascade in DBS means to do something along with some action.

Such as to "UPDATE/DELETE a table.field when another table.filed is updated/deleted"

## SQL:2011 Spec

`ON DELETE CASCADE`: if a row of the referenced table is deleted, then all matching rows in the referencing table are deleted.

`ON DELETE SET NULL`: if a row of the referenced table is deleted, then all referencing columns in all matching rows of the referencing table to be set to null.

`ON DELETE SET DEFAULT`: if a row of the referenced table is deleted, then all referencing columns in all matching rows of the referencing table to be set to the columnâ€™s default value.

`ON DELETE RESTRICT`: it is prohibited to delete a row of the referenced table if that row has any matching rows in the referencing table.

`ON DELETE NO ACTION` (the default): there is no referential delete action; the referential constraint only specifies a constraint check.
