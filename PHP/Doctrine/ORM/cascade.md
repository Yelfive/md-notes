Cascade 

## SQL:2011 Spec

ON DELETE CASCADE: if a row of the referenced table is deleted, then all matching rows in the referencing table are deleted.
ON DELETE SET NULL: if a row of the referenced table is deleted, then all referencing columns in all matching rows of the referencing table to be set to null.
ON DELETE SET DEFAULT: if a row of the referenced table is deleted, then all referencing columns in all matching rows of the referencing table to be set to the columnâ€™s default value.
ON DELETE RESTRICT: it is prohibited to delete a row of the referenced table if that row has any matching rows in the referencing table.
ON DELETE NO ACTION (the default): there is no referential delete action; the referential constraint only specifies a constraint check.
